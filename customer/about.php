        Signature Cuisine is more than just a restaurant; it's a tale of passion, tradition, and exceptional flavors that began in the heart of Sri Lanka. Our story starts on Flower Road, Colombo 07, where a small family eatery opened its doors in 1927.

      From humble beginnings, our founders poured their hearts into every dish they served, and word quickly spread about our delectable cuisine. Signature Cuisine became a local favorite, cherished for its authentic Sri Lankan flavors and warm hospitality.<br><br>
      Over the decades, we've grown and evolved, always staying true to our roots. Today, we are proud to have 11 branches across the country, each one a testament.<br><br>
